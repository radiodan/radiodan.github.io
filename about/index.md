<h2 id="people">About us</h2>

Dan, Andrew and Libby at BBC R&D are the main people working on Radiodan at the moment, with Dan 
focused on the core Radiodan code, Andrew working on the physical interface and example app, and 
Libby doing rough prototypes, testing and docs. Contact Libby in the first instance for help - by 
Twitter is best - [@libbymiller](http://twitter.com/libbymiller).

A bit more about us:

[Andrew Nicolaou](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/people/andrew-nicolaou) [@andrewn](http://twitter.com/andrewn) is a User Interface Developer for BBC R&D. He's interested in prototyping future 
connected experiences across TV, radio and online, particularly using emerging web technologies and tangible interfaces.

Daniel Nuttall [@pixelblend](http://twitter.com/pixelblend) is a Software engineer for Internet Research and Future Services in BBC R&D. He has 
worked for a range of companies in Europe and Africa, building web sites, browser extensions, 
servers and everything in between using open-source software.

Libby Miller [@libbymiller](http://twitter.com/libbymiller) is a producer and developer at the BBC, working on open APIs for connected devices. 
She used to work at failed online TV startup Joost, and before that on FOAF and Semantic Web query 
languages at the University of Bristol. She's got a PhD in Economics, for all the use that is.
