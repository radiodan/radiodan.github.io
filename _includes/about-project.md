Radiodan is Open Source software that lets you build your own internet radio on
a Raspberry Pi or in pure software.

[We've](/about) built it using BBC radio streams, but it is easy to use
with other sources of audio. It can
run on most UNIX-based operating systems, with particular emphasis on
[Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/).

You can look at [showcases](http://radiodan.net/showcase/) we have made with 
the Open Source [code](https://github.com/radiodan), and read more about 
[what it's 
for](http://planb.nicecupoftea.org/2015/01/27/what-is-radiodan-for/). Or [get 
started](/help) making a radio right away.

<h2>Why?</h2>
We're interested in different kinds of physical radio
devices and how we might change their functionality to make them better. We
think that it's only possible to test what makes a radio better by building
devices that act like radios, and that the more people who can build them, the
more interesting the radios will be. If you like videos you can see our
[nextrad.io presentation](http://nextrad.io/videos/dan-nutall-libby-miller-radiodan-a-cheap-flexible-and-open-ip-radio/)
(9 minute video) which explains more about what we are trying to do.
