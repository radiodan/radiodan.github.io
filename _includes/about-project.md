Radiodan is Open Source software that lets you build your own internet radio on
a Raspberry Pi or in pure software.

[We've](/about) built it using some BBC radio streams, but it is easy to use
with other streams, and to add MP3 files (and other audio formats). It uses Ruby
code on top of [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/).


We've made it because we are interested in different kinds of physical radio
devices and how we might change their functionality to make them better. We
think that it's only possible to test what makes a radio better by building
devices that act like radios, and that the more people who can build them, the
more interesting the radios will be. If you like videos you can see our
[nextrad.io presentation](http://nextrad.io/videos/dan-nutall-libby-miller-radiodan-a-cheap-flexible-and-open-ip-radio/)
(9 minute video) which explains more about what we are trying to do.


[Radiodan](https://github.com/radiodan/radiodan) and
[Radiodan Example app](https://github.com/radiodan/radiodan_example) are
alpha-quality software, but we've released a
[version 1](/2013/12/24/release.html) while we work on version 2, and if you'd
like to have a play,
[the instructions are here](https://github.com/radiodan/project/blob/master/docs/getting_started.markdown)
(but do get in [touch](2014/01/08/about-us.html), we are happy to help, and you
may need it!).
