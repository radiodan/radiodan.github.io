Radiodan is Open Source software that lets you build your own internet audio device on
a Raspberry Pi or in pure software.

It can run on most UNIX-based operating systems, with particular emphasis on [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/).

You can look at [showcases](http://radiodan.net/showcase/) we have made with 
the Open Source [code](https://github.com/andrewn/neue-radio), and read more about 
[what it's for](https://planb.nicecupoftea.org/2015/09/09/radiodan-part-1-expanding-the-overton-window-for-radios/). Or [get 
started](/help) making a radio right away.

<h2>Why?</h2>

There is an argument that radios just do a job and do it well. The [postcards](http://radiodan.net/2013/10/25/postcards-and-stickers.html) people 
made when we asked them about what they wanted from a radio say something else: there are lots of potential features of radio that people would 
enjoy that don't exist.

Many won't be viable in the slightest, but some might be, and we can't build them – whether as a physical device or in an app – if they aren't 
part of what we consider to be part of the "radio" class of products. As [Richard Pope](https://blog.memespring.co.uk/2014/11/10/product-land-1/) 
puts it:

"You can't build what you can't think of in the first place."

There's also a genuine, interesting, argument about accessibility here. If you don't ask a wide range of people what they want from a device, you 
probably won't be able to guess what it is they want or need. The postcards surprised us. We were getting slivers of light into bits of the 
product space for radio that we hadn't considered. We've recently expanded this line of thinking in the [Better Radio Experiences 
project](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/better-radio-experiences).

Finally, features implemented as rough physical objects allow meaningful and interesting feedback on the feature rather than its implementation. 
If it's a good idea it could then be instantiated as an app or a webpage - or less likely, as a physical device. Screens are boring and 
distracting, but objects are interesting and fun. Radiodan enables us to quickly generate lots of physical objects, to test the widest possible 
space of ideas.

If you like videos you can watch our [nextrad.io 
presentation](http://nextrad.io/videos/dan-nutall-libby-miller-radiodan-a-cheap-flexible-and-open-ip-radio/) (9 minute video) which explains more 
about what we are trying to do.
