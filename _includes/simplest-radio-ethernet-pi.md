### Plug everything together

Insert the SD card into the Pi.

Plug the ethernet cable into the Pi and connect to your router or other internet connection.

If you're using a USB audio card plug that into the Pi and plug your speaker into the audio card, making sure to put it into the hole marked with headphones.

If you're not using a USB audio card, plug your speaker into the sound jack on the Pi directly.

Plug the Pi into the power source and wait.
