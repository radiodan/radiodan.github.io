    - a USB-powered sound card
    - a 5cm diameter speaker soldered to a 3.5mm audio jack
    - buttons and dials - see [this tutorial](buttons-and-dials.html) (you can make the case without first).
    - 4 x 3mm diameter bolts, 4cm or more in length, and 4 wingnuts or similar
    - 2 x 5mm diameter nuts to fit 2 short 2mm diameter screws to hold in the Pi

Radiodan laser-cut box: Steps
---

### Laser cut the pieces

Use [our case template](https://github.com/radiodan/hardware/tree/master/case).

### Assemble the base

Add the four bolts and the two internal mounts. Play particular attention 
to the placement of the arrows - they should point to the circular hole.

### Glue the nuts to the internal mount

Glue the nuts into the mount first. The mount fits both the model B and the new B+, but you need to glue the nuts into different holes depending on your model. The B+ holes are identified with a plus sign. It's easier to apply the glue to the holes, situate the screws in rough position on a flat surface and then manouver the internal mount piece over the top.

### Add three of the edge pieces, the corner pieces, and the internal mount

When the glue is set, fit the mount into the box, slotting it into the side pieces.

There are 8 corner pieces on each corner.

The four edge pieces just slot in.

### Add the wifi card, SD card and power supply to the Pi

Don't plug the Pi in yet.

Put the wifi card in the bottom USB slot.

### Put the Pi in the box

<p class="todo">missing image</p>

Secure it with the screws and the rubber washers.

If you have a model B+, the USB ports will be on the other side.

### Add the speaker

<p class="todo">missing image</p>

The speaker should sit tightly in the hole.

Attach the speaker's 3.5mm jack to the sound card, and the sound card into a USB port

### Add the speaker mount

<p class="todo">missing image</p>

It fits tightly into the gap between the internal mount and the side pieces, and holds the speaker in.

### Add the back of the case

<p class="todo">missing image</p>

Using the butterfly screws, and feeding the power cable through the hole in the back of the case.

### Enjoy your Radiodan
