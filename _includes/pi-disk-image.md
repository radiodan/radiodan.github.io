### Download the pre-made disk image and uncompress it

[Download the disk image](http://dev.notu.be/2014/12/radiodan/) and save it to your computer.

You can usually uncompress the disk image by double-clicking on it.

### Flash a blank SD card with the image

You now need to flash the downloaded disk image onto your SD card.
[Follow the instructions on the Raspberry Pi site](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md), start at **WRITING AN IMAGE TO THE SD CARD** as you've just downloaded the image you want to flash onto the card.

<p class="todo">Include instructions on renaming the radio at this point?</p>
