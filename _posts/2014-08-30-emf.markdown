I'm at <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org">EMFCamp</a>, which is an incredible place. 

I presented about Radiodan a couple of hours ago, and this post is in case anyone would like to make one of their own.

Here's what you need:

* a [Radiodan Raspberry PI img](http://dev.notu.be/2014/08/radiodan_img/) that works
* [draft case-building documentation](https://github.com/radiodan/project/blob/master/docs/case_construction.md) and the [case as pdf](https://github.com/radiodan/project/blob/master/docs/assets/radiodan_3mm_laser_template.pdf)
* a [getting started document](https://github.com/radiodan/project/blob/master/docs/getting_started.markdown) for the software
* a handy [REST API](https://github.com/radiodan/magic-button/blob/master/doc/http-api.md) for the magic button functionalities (e.g. changing station, turning it on and off, setting the volume and so on).

So if you'd like a go, you can start 
[here](https://github.com/radiodan/project/blob/master/docs/case_construction.md).

Here's a field Radiodan:
