<h1>Examples of what we (and others) have made with Radiodan so far</h1>

The idea of Radiodan is that anyone should be able to make an 
interesting radio. To make sure this is possible, we've been making our 
own, and one or two others have been making them too.

<h2>BuckleyWilliams' Bulletin</h2>

The beautiful <a 
href="http://buckleywilliams.com/case-studies/bulletin/">Bulletin</a> 
was made as "a small, almost pocket-sized radio device thatâ€™s connected 
to the internet. It aims to keep you informed about things you might be 
interested in. It will tell you the weather, the time, cricket scores, 
latest tweets from your friends, latest blog posts from kottke.org, 
these kinds of things."

<h2>Project Bedtime</h2>

An extremely quick prototype made as part of our "Tellybox" work in BBC 
R&D. It's a stand-alone binaural ambient BBC player with a remote 
control on a pi Zero with a Phat DAC, using [Andrew 
Nicolaou's](https://twitter.com/andrewn) [Radiodan 
Neue](https://github.com/andrewn/neue-radio).

<h2>A Radio 3 "Red Button" prototype</h2>

A prototype made for Connected Studio, which allows you to switch between 
different strands of audio for a particular programme.

<h2>Magic Button Radio</h2>

The Magic Button radio is a fully-functional radio with a customisable 
button, and both a physical and a web interface. It's our most complete 
prototype and comes working out of the box when you install Radiodan. 
It's written by Andrew Nicolaou and Dan Nuttall and designed by Andrew 
Wood, with wifi interactions by Joanne Moore and sounds by Pete Warren.

<h2>Podcast in a box</h2>

Podcast in a box uses RFID cards to change the podcast being played. It's 
an experiment by Libby Miller to get to know the Radiodan code. Full step-by-step instructions are <a 
href="http://planb.nicecupoftea.org/2015/01/03/raspberry-pi-podcast-in-a-box-step-by-step/">here</a>.

<h2>GCal Radio</h2>

This radio is by Dan Nuttall. It enables you to connect your radio with a 
Google calendar, and then you can set the radio to play what you want, 
when you want it to play.

<h2>Book at Bedtime Radio</h2>

Joanne Moore's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtlx">Book at 
Bedtime</a> radio has a physical form like a book. It's currently a 
"maquette" - a physical model showing how it would work.

<h2>Playlist-follow radio</h2>

Andrew Nicolaou's Playlist-follow radio allows you to follow BBC Playlister presenter and TV show playlists using a physical interface. You can play back entire tracks via Spotify.

<h2>Exclusively Archers</h2>

Libby Miller's Exclusively Archers radio only plays the Archers, 
switching itself on for the Archers and off again afterwards. It's very 
quick to make, and uses a crontab. Instructions are <a 
href="http://planb.nicecupoftea.org/2015/01/25/a-quick-radiodan-exclusively-archers/">here</a>.

<h2>Archers Avoider</h2>

This was the first instance of Radiodan and was the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2013/09/prototyping-radio-experiences-with-radiodan">idea</a> that led to the project. This is a Mark 4.
