<div class="post">
<p>I had a very interesting conversation at <a href="http://bristol.hackspace.org.uk">Bristol Hackspace</a> a 
couple of months ago. I was trying to explain what on earth I was trying to do and why. The 
<a href="http://planb.nicecupoftea.org/2013/04/16/archers-avoider/">Archers Avoider</a> makes it easier 
than usual for me to explain what I do - often when I get asked I start thinking about it and 
then I&#39;m not sure what on earth I am doing, and plunge into a confused and rambling description 
of the lots of stuff that I do at work. The Archers Avoider is easy to explain (&quot;you press the 
button and it avoids the Archers&quot;) and sparked a conversation with Richard, Anton and Ian 
started about the kinds of radios that they would like to see and I started drawing boxes and 
circles in a notepad.</p>

<p>I really like this way of working. You end up with a fluid back-and-forth about what it would 
do, and there&#39;s something about having a picture that conveys what you are talking about in an 
engaging manner with an immediacy that&#39;s lacking in a written description.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/wrong_radio1.jpg" "A wrong radio" width="500" /></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why it works so well - these are scribbles really. <a href="https://twitter.com/psd">@psd</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/evalottchen">@evalottchen</a> do beautiful and engaging pictures but these 
are much more primitive. But it&#39;s clear that for some reason drawing things is a good way of 
getting people to think about the ideas they have, and it seems like an excellent way of coming 
up with requirements for Radiodan. At this stage, the more features the better. I&#39;ve been 
listening to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/iots/all">In Our Time Science archive</a> a lot 
recently, and I want a kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian 
Explosion</a> of ideas for radios 
(<a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/iots/iots_20050217-0900a.mp3">mp3</a>).</p>

<p>Various conversations with Richard at the Hackspace and AndrewN of team Radiodan suggested that 
some people would be less keen on drawing these things themselves, and that some sort of a 
template would be useful. So we made some simple postcards and stickers at Moo.</p>

<p>I then tried out the process at the <a href="http://xmlsummerschool.com">XML Summer School</a>. I was 
amazed at how well it went, and how enthusiastic people were about it, and at the lovely ideas 
that people came up with. You can see most of them in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/2386878@N23/">Flickr 
pool</a>. Here&#39;s one of my favourites:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/robin.jpg" "Robin's radio" width="500" /></p>

<p><i>Robin / Philip: always filter this out; mute when phone rings; fast forward button; dammit I missed that; kill button on a remote and then a backup one in case you don&#39;t make it there in time.</i></p>

<p>and another:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/matt.jpg" "Matt's radio" width="500" /></p>

<p><i>Matt: hit the button and you get something from In Our Time on the subject (there probably is something!)</i></p>

<p>and another:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/psd.jpg" "Paul's radio" width="500" /></p>

<p><i>Paul said: &quot;My radio is mostly fine - my only interaction is when John Humphries comes on - so this allows you to give him a stroke when he&#39;s nice but give him an electric shock when e.g. he talks about science&quot;</i></p>

<p>I&#39;ve since run a similar event at the MediaScape project kickoff meeting, with equally 
interesting results.</p>

<p>This is the basic process that I&#39;ve used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce the problem with devices - I explain that radios are relatively inflexible, hard to change, and that its difficult to experiment with their behaviour or appearance</li>
<li>Explain about Radiodan and the possibilities we have now of creating new prototypes easily and quickly</li>
<li>Present some examples - with pictures - of possible radios, how things could be made better or or more interesting </li>
<li>Ask them to draw what is is they are interested in - &quot;what would your wrong radio do?&quot; with postcards and stickers, in small groups or on their own</li>
<li>Ask them to present their results back to the group, document them using photos and text.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, people usually get the idea without much introduction at all (I&#39;ve tried it in the 
pub and it works perfectly well :-)</p>

<p>The main idea is to give people some ideas and tools, get them enthused and interested, let them 
talk about their ideas, listen to them, and ensure they get credit. And somehow, in a way 
mysterious to me...it works. It&#39;s fun and produces lots of interesting ideas.</p>

<p>I hope that we can run more of these sessions and for different kinds of devices. We&#39;re at the 
stage now of starting to work out what we do with this information. It&#39;s not clear to me if we 
should look for regularities - or outliers - or both. We&#39;re getting some help from some user 
experience experts in the BBC on how best to do this, which is great.</p>

<p>For now, here are some clusters of interesting areas, things that keep coming up:</p>

<ul>
<li>skip a programme or person or track or commercial</li>
<li>learn what I like with like / hate buttons</li>
<li>play to my mood (for music)</li>
<li>popular / against the crowd (for music)</li>
<li>I want to know more in depth about a topic</li>
<li>muting / louder when detects things like cooking noises, kettle on, phone, conversation, speech vs music</li>
<li>rewind a bit - just missed something</li>
<li>what was that song (specifically)? who played that version? email it / tweet it to me</li>
<li>integrate podcasts / my music, especially related to what I&#39;ve been listening to</li>
<li>feed back to the studio in visceral ways</li>
<li>interact with it via speech / audio</li>
<li>randomise</li>
<li>listen again</li>
<li>radio 4 + 1</li>
<li>&quot;no-touch&quot; perfect radio</li>
</ul>
